# Music-Application-Database
This is a project about a music store in which users would buy songs from various artists from different countries with different genres. Each song has its properties like price and the artist that sang it and the song duration and so on. The employees can add artists onto the platform so that they can upload their songs for users to later purchase and listen.
Artists around the world will first contact the music store in order to be verified as a music artist and after being verified by the employees, they can add their songs onto the platform and also classify which genre the song will be placed under. And then users can purchase songs from genres of their choices and listen to them as much as they want.

NOTE: This project might only be able to run on MSSQL.
